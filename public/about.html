<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>My 'developer' journey started on 28th August 2024 when I took part in my first online lesson in the CFG Javascipt Bootcamp. I enjoyed the lesson so much that I very quickly enrolled on the Udemy Complete Web Development Bootcamp and got stuck into HTML coding. Although I have only learnt to code very basic websites that are reminiscent of 90s web pages, I have become hooked on coding. I have been using other rescources like the Mimo coding app and a 1hr express webinar with SheCodes and I was able to pick up a few basic CSS language elements which I added to a nonsense website filled with lorum picsum. I will be posting further projects as my skills in coding improve so I can reflect back on my progression.</p>

<p>My other interest is landscape and macro photography which I have been doing since 2018. My favourite locations are woodlands and forests.  I look forward to Sundays where I can spend a few hours in nature, take lots of images and edit the RAW files.</p>

<p>My goal is to change career in 2025 and eventually become a front end developer. I have the very basics of HTML and I am just starting to learn CSS so hopefully my future projects will look a little more interesting. Alongside this, I am working on a better understanding of Javascript which I hope to be able to incorporate into my projects very soon. Looking ahead, my next challenge will be to get to grips with React as soon as I am able.
