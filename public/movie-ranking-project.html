<h1>Movie Ranking</h1>
<h2>My 3 Favourite Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Terminator 2 🤖</h3>
<p>Most expensive film made at the time and groundbreaking special effects. T2 is my favourite movie of all time and I have not watched a single scene of the latter sequels.</p>
<h3>The Green Mile 🐭</h3>
<p>I am a big fan of Stephen King and this along with The Shawshank Redemption were the best adaptations of his work in my opinion, also; Mr Bojangles.</p>
<h3>Some Like it Hot 🎺</h3>
<p>A great movie that I don't tire of watching, funny and feel good.</p>
